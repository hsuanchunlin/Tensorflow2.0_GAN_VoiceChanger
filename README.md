# Tensorflow2.0_GAN_VoiceChanger
This is my small project for fun for deep voice changer. The original codes is from [Lei Mao's work in TensorFlow 1.8](https://github.com/leimao/Voice-Converter-CycleGAN) 
I have reformulated the codes to adapt Mac-optimized TensorFlow 2.0 to utilize my 15' Macbook Pro 2019 for training.
