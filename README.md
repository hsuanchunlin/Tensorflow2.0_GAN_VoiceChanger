# Tensorflow2.0_GAN_VoiceChanger
This is my small project for fun for deep voice changer. The original codes is from [Lei Mao's work in TensorFlow 1.8](https://github.com/leimao/Voice-Converter-CycleGAN) \
To construct CycleGAN, I have referenced the [keras tutorial](https://keras.io/examples/generative/cyclegan/).\
The codes are reformulated to adapt Mac-optimized TensorFlow 2.0 to optimize training on my 15' Macbook Pro 2019.
